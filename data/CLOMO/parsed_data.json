Statement2: One form of the molecule kills weeds, while the other has no effect on them.

Statement2: People experience dreams during only one of these periods, known as rem ( rapid eye movement ) sleep. Test subjects who are chronically deprived of rem sleep become irritable during waking life. Statement3: This shows that rem sleep relieves the stresses of waking life."
